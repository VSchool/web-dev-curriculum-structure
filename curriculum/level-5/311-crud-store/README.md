# Crud Store

# Overview

This exercise is your first foray into implementing mongoose into your express server. You will be making a CRUD e-store inventory. Use postman to interface with all the items in your database.

# Objectives

## Part 1

- Build a new server and connect it to mongodb.
- In a folder called `models` create a file called `inventory.js` and define a `InventorySchema` for items in your store. Export a `InventoryModel` at the bottom.

## Part 2

- Create a new folder called `routes` containing a file `inventory.js`.
- Create all the necessary routes to make a fully CRUD application (GET, GET(one), POST, PUT, DELETE, ).
- Populate your inventory using Postman. Be sure to test each endpoint.
