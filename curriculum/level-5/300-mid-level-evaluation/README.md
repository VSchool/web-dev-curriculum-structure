# Mid Level 5

This is a moment for you to test your coding skills and prepare yourself for an interview. Below you will see two code challenges for you to complete. You will also need to add comments or pseudo-code to your project in order to describe your process. Next you will complete a quiz that will test the knowledge you have gained so far. Once you have completed the challenges, schedule an assessment to review with an instructor and do a third coding challenge live!

# Code Challenges:

### **Extract Unique Characters:**

Write a function called **`extractUniqueCharacters`** that takes an array of strings and returns a new array containing only the unique characters from all the strings.

```jsx
function extractUniqueCharacters(strings) {
  
}

const words = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
const uniqueChars = extractUniqueCharacters(words);
console.log(uniqueChars); // Output: ['a', 'p', 'l', 'e', 'b', 'n', 'c', 'h', 'r', 'y']
```

### **Sort by Property:**

Write a function called **`sortByProperty`** that takes an array of objects and a property name as input. The function should return a new array containing the objects sorted in ascending order based on the specified property.

```jsx
function sortByProperty(objects, propertyName) {
  
}

const people = [
  { name: 'Alice', age: 30 },
  { name: 'Bob', age: 25 },
  { name: 'Charlie', age: 35 },
  { name: 'David', age: 28 },
];

const sortedByAge = sortByProperty(people, 'age');
console.log(sortedByAge);
```
