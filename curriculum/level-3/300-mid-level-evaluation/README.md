# Mid Level 3 Skill Check

This is a moment for you to test your coding skills and prepare yourself for an interview. Below you will see two code challenges for you to complete. You will also need to add comments or pseudo-code to your project in order to describe your process and solution. Next you will complete a quiz that will test the knowledge you have gained so far. Once you have completed the challenges and quiz, schedule an assessment to review with an instructor and do a third coding challenge live!

## Code Challenges

### Challenge 1: S**ort Array with Preserved Index for -1 Values**

You are given an array a containing integers. Your task is to implement the solution function to sort the array in ascending order, while preserving the original index positions of -1 values.

Write a function solution(a) that takes in an array a and returns a new array with the following conditions:

All non -1 values in the array should be sorted in ascending order.
The -1 values should retain their original index positions in the sorted array.

```jsx
function solution(arr){

}

console.log(solution([-1, 150, 190, 170, -1, -1, 160, 180]))
console.log(solution([5, 3, 1]))
console.log(solution([-1, -1, -1, -1]))
console.log(solution([100, -1, 50, -1, 75]))
```

### Challenge 2: **Count Vowels**

Write a JavaScript function called **`countVowels`** that takes a string as input and counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string. The function should return the count.

Implement the **`countVowels`** function using either the provided example solutions or your own solution.

```jsx
const input = 'Hello, World!';

console.log(countVowels(input)); // Output: 3
```

```jsx
const input = 'Counting Vowels';

console.log(countVowels(input)); // Output: 5
```
