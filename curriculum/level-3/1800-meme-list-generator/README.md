### **Additional Tips**

- Do not set the ID from the meme image as the ID for each created meme. This will cause issues if 2 or more memes use the same image. You can either use the index number from the meme list as the ID or use a [UUID generator package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid)
- Preform an HTTP request to "https://api.imgflip.com/get_memes" to get a list of memes.
- See the [API Documentation](https://imgflip.com/api)
