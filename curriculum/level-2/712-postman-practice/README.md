# Postman Practice

For problems #1 and #2, reference the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/documentation)

1. Use Postman to GET a list of planets.
2. Use Postman to GET a single person object.

For problems below, use the `https://api.vschool.io/[your_name]/todo` endpoint.

1. Use Postman to POST 3 new todo objects. Run another GET to see them. Use the following template for your JSON body:

```json
{
  "title": "This is required",
  "description": "This is optional",
  "price": 0, //must be a number
  "imgUrl": "http://path-to-url.jpg",
  "completed": false //must be boolean
}

```

1. GET one single todo using its `id` property.
2. DELETE one single todo using its `id` property.
3. PUT one single todo using its `id` property.
