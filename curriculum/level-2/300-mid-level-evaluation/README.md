# Mid Level 2

# Introduction

This is a moment for you to test your coding skills and prepare yourself for an interview. Below you will see two code challenges for you to complete. You will also need to add comments to your code in order to describe your process and solution. Next you will complete a quiz that will test the knowledge you have gained so far. Once you have completed the challenges and quiz, schedule an assessment to review with an instructor and do a third coding challenge live! 

## **Challenge 1: Sorting an Array**

Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array with the numbers sorted in ascending order.

```jsx
function sortNumbers(numbers) {
//your code here
}
```

```jsx
// Example usage:
const numbers = [4, 2, 7, 1, 9, 5];
const sortedNumbers = sortNumbers(numbers);
console.log(sortedNumbers);  // Output: [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9]
```

## **Challenge 2: Mapping an Array**

Write a function that takes an array of strings and returns a new array where each string is converted to uppercase.

```jsx
function convertToUppercase(strings) {
// your code here
}
```

```jsx
// Example usage:
const strings = ['hello', 'world', 'javascript'];
const uppercaseStrings = convertToUppercase(strings);
console.log(uppercaseStrings);  // Output: ['HELLO', 'WORLD', 'JAVASCRIPT']
```
