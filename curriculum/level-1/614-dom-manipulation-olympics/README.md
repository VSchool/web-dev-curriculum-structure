# DOM Olympics

## Introduction

Welcome to the DOM Olympics! This exercise is designed to help you become comfortable with DOM manipulation using pure JavaScript. Each step will provide a challenge to reinforce your understanding of commonly used syntax in the industry. Take your time and make sure to understand the purpose behind each piece of code you write.

## Setup

To get started, clone down the [dom-olympics-start](https://github.com/VSchool/dom-olympics-start) repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VSchool/dom-olympics-start
cd dom-olympics-start
```

Next, remove the hidden `.git` folder:

```bash
rm -rf .git
```

You will use this repository to work your way through the Olympic medals.

## Instructions

You will complete the requirements of this assignment using JavaScript only. This is a simple messaging app, and your job is to make it interactive. Feel free to make changes to the CSS if needed.

### Bronze Medal Challenge

Your first task is to use pure JavaScript to insert a header to the top of this page. It should include your name and have a different color.

### Silver Medal Challenge

There's some subpar conversation going on in this messaging app. You have two tasks to help improve it:
- Write custom JavaScript to automatically change the words of the conversation to something fun and positive.
- Write JavaScript that waits until the user clicks the "clear" button and then clears out all conversation.

### Gold Medal Challenge

Let's add some themes! Use the dropdown menu to write JavaScript that detects when the dropdown has changed and changes the background colors of the messages accordingly.

## Conclusion

Have fun with the challenges and remember to take your time understanding each step!


## Submitting your assignment

To submit your assignment, you need to push your changes to GitHub. Follow these steps:

### Using Git Command Line

Follow these steps to push your changes to GitHub using Git command line.

Open your Terminal and follow the steps below:


1. **Add Your Changes**: Add the files you have worked on. If you want to add all changes:
   ```git add .```

   If you want to add only a specific folder, use:
   ```git add path/to/your/folder```

2. **Commit Your Changes**: Commit the changes with a meaningful message:
   ```git commit -m "Add assignment submission for [your name]"```

3. **Push to GitHub**: Push the changes to the GitHub repository:
   ```git push origin main```

### Using VSCode's Source Control

Alternatively, you can use VSCode's built-in Source Control feature:

1. **Open the Repository**: Click on the source control tab in VSCode.

2. **Stage Your Changes**: Stage the files you want to submit by clicking the "+" icon next to each file or folder in the Source Control view.

3. **Commit Your Changes**: Enter a commit message in the text field at the top of the Source Control view and press Enter to commit your changes.

4. **Push to GitHub**: Click the three dots (...) in the top-right corner of the Source Control view and select "Push" from the dropdown menu to push your changes to GitHub.

### Example: Pushing a Specific Folder

If you only want to push changes from a specific folder (e.g., `assignments/week1`), you can do so using either method above.

By following these steps, you can successfully submit your assignment to GitHub using either Git command line or VSCode's Source Control.
