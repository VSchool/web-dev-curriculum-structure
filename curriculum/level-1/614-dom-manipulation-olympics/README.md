# DOM Olympics

## Introduction

Welcome to the DOM Olympics! This exercise is designed to help you become comfortable with DOM manipulation using pure JavaScript. Each step will provide a challenge to reinforce your understanding of commonly used syntax in the industry. Take your time and make sure to understand the purpose behind each piece of code you write.

## Setup

To get started, clone down the [dom-olympics-start](https://github.com/VSchool/dom-olympics-start) repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VSchool/dom-olympics-start
cd dom-olympics-start
```

Next, remove the hidden `.git` folder:

```bash
rm -rf .git
```

You will use this repository to work your way through the Olympic medals.

## Instructions

You will complete the requirements of this assignment using JavaScript only. This is a simple messaging app, and your job is to make it interactive. Feel free to make changes to the CSS if needed.

### Bronze Medal Challenge

Your first task is to use pure JavaScript to insert a header to the top of this page. It should include your name and have a different color.

### Silver Medal Challenge

There's some subpar conversation going on in this messaging app. You have two tasks to help improve it:
- Write custom JavaScript to automatically change the words of the conversation to something fun and positive.
- Write JavaScript that waits until the user clicks the "clear" button and then clears out all conversation.

### Gold Medal Challenge

Let's add some themes! Use the dropdown menu to write JavaScript that detects when the dropdown has changed and changes the background colors of the messages accordingly.

## Conclusion

Have fun with the challenges and remember to take your time understanding each step!
