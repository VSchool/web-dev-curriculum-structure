# Code Art School

Styling code can be a tricky task, sometimes requiring some good ol' guess-and-check changes to the CSS. Fortunately, doing this with code is a lot less permanent than doing this with your artwork.

### **Requirements**

Open [the project web page](http://sites.vschool.io/code-art-school/) in a new browser window. Your job is to change some styles right in your browser to make the content flow better, look less old-school and a lot more colorful.

We'll leave it up to you to decide which colors to use, but there are a few things you'll need to make sure to change:

- Add some color to the headers and the nav bar
- Resize the photos to be a little bigger and more visible
- Make the font a little bigger and change the color so it's more easily read.
- Change the font style so it's not terrible
- Change the font style so it's not terrible

### **WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT REFRESH OR NAVIGATE AWAY FROM THE PAGE.**

Since these changes are temporary, refreshing the page would undo all of your changes.

> Remember to submit your assignment by pushing it to Github!
