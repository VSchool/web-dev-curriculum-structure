# FizzBuzz Code Challenge

FizzBuzz is the must know coding challenge. 

Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line.

For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.

For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.

For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

### **Example:**

12fizz4buzzfizz78fizzbuzz11fizz1314fizzbuzz16ect.

### **Optional:**

- Write a function that keeps a tally of how often the phrases `"fizz"`,`"buzz"`, and `"fizzbuzz"` occur in the array returned from the previous function.
- It should return an object that looks like this:

```jsx
{
    fizzbuzz: 6,
    fizz: 27,
    buzz: 14
}
```
