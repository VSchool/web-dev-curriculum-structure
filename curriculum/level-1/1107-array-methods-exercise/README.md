## Submitting your assignment

To submit your assignment, you need to push your changes to GitHub. Follow these steps:

### Using Git Command Line

Follow these steps to push your changes to GitHub using Git command line.

Open your Terminal and follow the steps below:


1. **Add Your Changes**: Add the files you have worked on. If you want to add all changes:
   ```git add .```

   If you want to add only a specific folder, use:
   ```git add path/to/your/folder```

2. **Commit Your Changes**: Commit the changes with a meaningful message:
   ```git commit -m "Add assignment submission for [your name]"```

3. **Push to GitHub**: Push the changes to the GitHub repository:
   ```git push origin main```

### Using VSCode's Source Control

Alternatively, you can use VSCode's built-in Source Control feature:

1. **Open the Repository**: Click on the source control tab in VSCode.

2. **Stage Your Changes**: Stage the files you want to submit by clicking the "+" icon next to each file or folder in the Source Control view.

3. **Commit Your Changes**: Enter a commit message in the text field at the top of the Source Control view and press Enter to commit your changes.

4. **Push to GitHub**: Click the three dots (...) in the top-right corner of the Source Control view and select "Push" from the dropdown menu to push your changes to GitHub.

### Example: Pushing a Specific Folder

If you only want to push changes from a specific folder (e.g., `assignments/week1`), you can do so using either method above.

By following these steps, you can successfully submit your assignment to GitHub using either Git command line or VSCode's Source Control.
