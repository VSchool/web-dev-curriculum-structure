# Bugs on a plane

Fun Times! We get to practice more debugging!

Follow the commands below to download the buggy program and go through it squashing any bugs you find until it works correctly! There will be both syntactical and logical errors.

To download this code, run the following code one line at a time (fixing the first line to be the correct path to your exercises folder):

```jsx
# cd into your assignments/exercises folder
git clone https://github.com/VSchool/bugs-on-a-plane.git
cd bugs-on-a-plane/

# Copy/paste this command. You don't want to enter it incorrectly.
rm -rf .git

```

When all the bugs are fixed the app should look like this
