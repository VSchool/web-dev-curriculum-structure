# Daily Code Challenges

Welcome to the Daily Code Challenges folder! This repository is designed to help you organize and track your progress on daily coding challenges.

## Folder Structure

Create a new JavaScript file for each day's code challenge. Name each file based on the title of the challenge.

### Example Structure
```
Daily Code Challenges/
│
├── reverseArray.js
├── stringReversal.js
├── binarySearch.js
└── fibonacciSequence.js
```

## File Contents

Each JavaScript file should include:

1. The challenge description as a comment at the top.
2. The function or solution code for the challenge.

## Example File Content

Here is an example of what each JavaScript file might look like:

```javascript
// Challenge: Reverse Array
// Description: Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns the array with its elements reversed.

// Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
// Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

function reverseArray(arr) {
    // solution
}

// Example usage:
console.log(reverseArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])); // Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

## Conclusion

This folder structure will help you stay organized and make it easier to review your progress and refer back to past challenges. Happy coding, and enjoy tackling these daily code challenges!
