## Submitting your assignments

To submit your assignments, you need to push your changes to GitHub. Follow these steps:

### Using Git Command Line

Follow these steps to push your changes to GitHub using Git command line.

Open your Terminal and follow the steps below:


1. **Add Your Changes**: Add the files you have worked on. 
   ```git add <relative/path/to/assignment/folder>```

2. **Commit Your Changes**: Commit the changes with a meaningful message:
   ```git commit -m “submitting assignment <name>```

3. **Push to GitHub**: Push the changes to the GitHub repository:
   ```git push origin main```

### Using VSCode's Source Control

Alternatively, you can use VSCode's built-in Source Control feature:

1. **Open the Repository**: Click on the source control tab in VSCode.

2. **Stage Your Changes**: Stage the files you want to submit by clicking the "+" icon next to each file or folder in the Source Control view.

3. **Commit Your Changes**: Enter a commit message in the text field at the top of the Source Control view and press Enter to commit your changes.

4. **Push to GitHub**: Click the three dots (...) in the top-right corner of the Source Control view and select "Push" from the dropdown menu to push your changes to GitHub.

By following these steps, you can successfully submit your assignment to GitHub using either Git command line or VSCode's Source Control.
