# Web Development Course Workshops

Welcome to the Web Development Course Workshops folder! This repository is organized to help you keep track of all the materials and exercises for each workshop.

## Folder Structure

Create a new folder for each workshop you attend. Name each folder based on the title of the workshop.

### Example Structure
```
Web Development Course Workshops/
│
├── HTML_Basics/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── styles.css
│   └── script.js
│
├── CSS_Fundamentals/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── styles.css
│   └── script.js
│
└── JavaScript_Introduction/
    ├── index.html
    ├── styles.css
    └── script.js
```

Each folder should include all the files related to that workshop, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Happy coding, and enjoy your web development journey!
